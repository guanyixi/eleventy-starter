title: Building a Static Website Quickly and Easily with the GEM Stack
content: The GEM stack offers numerous benefits for static websites, including faster load times, enhanced security, and improved scalability, making it an excellent choice for high-performance web projects. My choice for the GEM stack is Eleventy (11ty), known for its simplicity and flexibility, allowing for the creation of customizable and efficient static sites. This type of website is best suited for small-scale content-driven projects such as blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites, where speed and reliability are crucial.
